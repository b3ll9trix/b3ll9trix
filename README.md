# Hi there 👋🏾, I'm Reshma 🐣

## Get to know me 🤝🏾
I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for Database Systems, Peformance and Tooling. I write code mostly in Go and closely follow the community. 
- 👍🏾 Likes about Go - Just one way to do something, easy concurrency/parallelism, being native and typed.
- 👎🏾 Dislikes about Go - Absence of immutability.

## What am I doing here? 🕹️
- Building side projects (mostly in Go)
- Looking for places to contribute to Open Source
- Configuring my `nvim` setup
- Automating stuff
  
## What else can I do? 🛍️
- Backend Systems in Go, Python, C++ 
- _Some_ Frontend Systems in React

## What do I wanna do up next?
- A (tiny) database in Rust 🚀

## Pet Peeve 🚧
- _Embarassingly Parallizable_ code not parallelized 😭
